PMK (Platform Managed Keys) are enabled by default in Azure managed disks and allow encryption at rest. CMK is the recommended because it gives the customer the option to control which specific keys are used for the encryption and decryption of the disk. The customer can then change keys and disable them increasing security, instead of relying on the PMK key that remains unchanging. There is also the option to increase security further by using automatically rotating keys, so that access to disk is ensured to be limited. However organizations should evaluate what their security requirements are for the data stored on the disk. For high risk data using CMK is a must, as it is extra steps of security. If the data is low risk, PMK is enabled by default, and provides sufficient data security.",
